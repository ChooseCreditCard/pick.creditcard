          Instead of starting with brand names or sign-up bonuses, Pick.Creditcard starts with structure:
          fees, protections, rewards and your credit profile – then connects you to neutral guides on
          Choose.Creditcard.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Why “How You Pick” Matters More Than the Logo</h2>
      <p>
        Many people pick a credit card based on the first ad they see, a friend’s story or a headline reward.
        That can work out by luck, but it can also mean hidden FX fees, missing insurance or rewards you never use.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better approach is to follow a small, repeatable checklist. This page outlines a simple way to think about
        what you need from a card before you ever click “apply”. It is educational only and does not recommend any
        specific issuer or product.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <section id="steps" class="section">
      <h2>Key Steps When You Pick a Credit Card</h2>
      <p>One way to structure the decision is to move through these steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. Map your usage:</strong> How often do you travel abroad? Do you carry a balance, or pay in full?
          Do you value lounges, insurance, or just low fees? Your pattern decides what matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Decide your fee tolerance:</strong> Are you okay with an annual fee if the card delivers value,
          or do you want no-fee only? How sensitive are you to FX mark-ups when you pay in foreign currencies?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Prioritise protections and clarity:</strong> Travel insurance, purchase protection,
          extended warranty and clear dispute processes often matter more than a slightly higher earn rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Choose a rewards style:</strong> Simple cashback, airline miles, hotel points or flexible
          bank points all behave differently. It is usually better to pick one main style and stick to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. Check your credit profile:</strong> Your credit score and history affect eligibility,
          limits and pricing. A “perfect” card on paper is useless if you cannot realistically qualify.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>6. Compare within a focused group:</strong> Once you know your pattern and constraints, compare
          a small group of relevant cards – not the whole market at once.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The guides on Choose.Creditcard are designed to make each of these pieces easier to understand in plain language.

    <!-- Mistakes -->
    <section id="mistakes" class="section">
      <h2>Common Mistakes When Picking a Card</h2>
      <p>Some pitfalls appear again and again, regardless of country or issuer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Chasing bonuses only:</strong> A sign-up bonus can be attractive, but if the card later
          charges high FX fees or interest, the headline reward may not be worth it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring FX fees:</strong> Travellers often focus on “no annual fee” and forget that 2–3% FX
          mark-ups can quietly cost more over a year than a reasonable annual fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overestimating lounge value:</strong> Lounges can be nice, but only if you actually fly often
          enough and the locations match your real routes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Not reading protection details:</strong> Travel insurance and purchase protection vary widely.
          Limits, exclusions and conditions can matter more than the label itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Confusing tools with advice:</strong> Comparison tables, calculators and helpers can highlight
          differences, but they do not replace official documentation or local regulation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Educational sites like The CreditCard Collection aim to highlight these trade-offs so you can ask better
        questions before applying.
